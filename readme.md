# OpenRCT2-VehicleGenerator

Python tool for generating custom vehicle `.parkobj` files for OpenRCT2.
Reads a ride JSON config + OBJ meshes, renders the full set of dimetric
sprites against Embree (via a pybind11 binding to a curated subset of
OpenRCT2's iso-render C++), and writes a ready-to-install parkobj.

A typical full single-rail-coaster vehicle (~4,640 sprites across two
car types with restraint animation) renders in **~10 seconds** on a
modern Mac.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Build
uv sync

# Render the wooden example and write openrct2vg.ride.single_rail_on_wooden.parkobj
uv run openrct2-vehicle-generator examples/wooden/classic_wooden.json

# Install into OpenRCT2 (macOS path; adjust for Linux/Windows)
cp openrct2vg.ride.single_rail_on_wooden.parkobj \
   ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenRCT2/object/

# Restart OpenRCT2 and the new train shows up in the vehicle dropdown
```

---

## Dependencies

| | |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Build | [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), CMake ≥ 3.25, a C++23 compiler |
| Runtime | Embree 4 (`brew install embree` on macOS; distro package on Linux) |

`uv sync` invokes scikit-build-core to compile
`openrct2_vehicle_generator/_native.so` against your installed Embree,
then installs the package editably into `.venv/`.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Full render -> writes object/ and <id>.parkobj in the cwd
uv run openrct2-vehicle-generator path/to/ride.json

# Quick single-viewpoint render per vehicle frame (no full sprite set)
# Outputs to test/ for visual iteration on meshes/lighting/materials.
uv run openrct2-vehicle-generator --test path/to/ride.json

# Reuse sprites from a previous full run; rebuild object.json + parkobj only
uv run openrct2-vehicle-generator --skip-render path/to/ride.json
```

All paths in the ride JSON (`meshes`, `preview`, `map_Kd` lines in .mtl)
are resolved relative to the **current working directory**, so run from
the repo root unless you've copied assets elsewhere.

---

## Examples

One example vehicle is included under `examples/`.

| Example | Ride type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wooden/` | `classic_wooden_rc` | A single-rail-styled car (mesh, materials, restraint animation, peep + peep_restraint mesh swap, 8 custom lights) running on the classic wooden coaster track. Renders **all 16 sprite groups** via `"sprites": "all"` so the vehicle looks correct if swapped onto more complex ride types in-game. |

Shared assets:

| Path | Used by |
|---|---|
| `textures/` | Generic material + remap textures (chassis, metal, seat, remap gradients) referenced from each example's `materials.mtl` |
| `examples/<ride>/{*.obj, materials.mtl, preview.png}` | Per-example meshes, materials, preview thumbnail |

Each example's JSON sets a custom `id` (`openrct2vg.ride.…`) so the
output doesn't collide with vanilla OpenRCT2 objects.

                                Embree 4 (BVH ray tracing, OS lib)
```

**What's in C++:** the rendering hot path — Embree scene management, AA
(4×4 subsamples), ambient occlusion (8×4 hemisphere samples), Blender-
style specular shading, Floyd-Steinberg palette dither, and image-frame
quantization. Around 1500 LOC of OpenRCT2 source compiled into the
extension; the binding marshalling layer is ~250 LOC.

**What's in Python:** everything that doesn't need to be fast — OBJ/MTL
parsing, JSON loading + validation (with implied-sprite-flag logic),
ride dataclasses, sprite-group dispatch (the rotation tables for each of
the 16 sprite groups), object.json construction, .parkobj zipping.

**Why this split:** the C++ pipeline (`makevehicle` + `maketrack` +
`merge_parkobj.py`) was already a working renderer but tightly coupled
to assimp / libpng / libzip / jansson. Replacing them with their Python
counterparts (Pillow, stdlib `json` / `zipfile`, a hand-written OBJ
parser) eliminates four native deps without giving up Embree speed —
the only native dep we still need is the ray tracer itself.

## Sprite output format

The exporter writes **one PNG per sprite** (`images/car_<vehicle>_<NNNN>.png`)
with image entries shaped like

```json
{
  "path": "images/car_0_0042.png",
  "x": -10,
  "y": -11,
  "palette": "keep"
}
```

It does **not** atlas-pack into one large PNG per car with `src_x` /
`src_y` / `src_width` / `src_height` sub-rect refs.

### Why no atlases?

OpenRCT2's `ImageImporter` silently rejects any PNG larger than 256×256.
Fully-loaded single-rail atlases come out around 720×720 — way over the
limit, so every sprite in the atlas renders invisible in-game (you can
select the vehicle in the build menu but it draws as a blank tile, and
the preview thumbnail is empty too). This is the same reason the
upstream C++ `makevehicle` output requires a post-process pass through
`scripts/split_atlas.py` before it'll work in current OpenRCT2.

By emitting per-sprite PNGs directly, the exporter produces a working
parkobj in one step, no post-processing required. Tradeoff: the parkobj
is ~10× larger on disk (5 MB vs 500 KB), because each tiny sprite is
its own zlib-compressed PNG with separate headers and a 768-byte PLTE
chunk. For ride vehicle objects this is fine; for thousands of tiny
sprites a binary `$LGX:images.dat[…]` blob (the vanilla OpenRCT2
format) would be more compact, but that path isn't implemented yet.

---

## OpenRCT2 format notes worth knowing

A handful of things bit us during development; preserving them here so
future contributors don't repeat the debugging.

| Gotcha | What |
|---|---|
| **PNG ≤ 256×256** | OpenRCT2's `ImageImporter` silently skips larger PNGs. Vehicles end up invisible even though the JSON parses and the object loads. See the per-sprite output approach above. |
| **Object ID collisions** | A custom parkobj whose `id` matches a vanilla one (e.g. `rct1.ride.wooden_rc_trains`) won't override it cleanly — the engine keeps both around and you can't tell them apart in the dropdown. Use the `openrct2vg.ride.*` namespace (or your own `<author>.ride.*`) to avoid collision. |
| **Two RCT2 palettes** | OpenRCT2's source has *two* near-identical 256-color palette tables: the **internal** one (Palette.cpp `palette_rct2`) used for nearest-color quantization, and the **image** one (Image.cpp `rct2_palette`) written into PNG PLTE chunks. They differ at indices 0–9 (placeholder ramp vs all zeros) and 243–254 (red/orange remap1 vs green remap). PNG output **must** use the image palette — the engine recognizes the remap region by the PLTE layout. `palette.py` sources from Image.cpp. |
| **Vehicle objects don't bundle track sprites** | Track piece sprites come from OpenRCT2's built-in data per `ride_type`. A custom `.parkobj` only needs to provide vehicle sprites (4640 for a fully-fledged coaster + 3 preview entries = 4643 image entries — matches vanilla). The `maketrack` / `merge_parkobj.py` step from the C++ pipeline isn't required for vehicle-only customization. |
| **Object cache** | OpenRCT2 caches object metadata in `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRCT2/objects.idx`. After installing a new parkobj, **restart OpenRCT2** — it doesn't hot-reload the object dir. |

---

## Authoring a new vehicle

1. **Model in Blender.** Export the car body and any sub-meshes (front
   variant, peep, restraint, peep+restraint locked-in pose) as `.obj`
   with a shared `materials.mtl`. Naming conventions in material names
   trigger special handling (mirrors `Mesh.cpp` in iso-render):

   | Substring | Effect |
   |---|---|
   | `Remap1` / `Remap2` / `Remap3` | Player-recolorable (palette regions 1/2/3) |
   | `Greyscale` | Shaded into greyscale ramp (palette region 4) |
   | `Peep` | Peep palette region (5) |
   | `Chain` | Chain lift palette region (6) |
   | `Mask` | Cutout mask (transparency) |
   | `VisibleMask` | Cutout mask that still blocks AO |
   | `NoAO` | Skip ambient occlusion sampling |
   | `Edge` / `DarkEdge` | Background-AA / dark background-AA edges |
   | `NoBleed` | Don't bleed pixel colors across atlas seams |
   | `FlatShaded` | Disable normal smoothing on this material |

2. **Write the JSON config.** Use one of the `examples/` configs as a
   starting point. Required fields are validated by `loader.py` — error
   messages will tell you what's missing or misshapen.

   The `sprites` field controls which of the 16 sprite groups to
   render. Two forms accepted:

   ```json
   "sprites": ["flat", "gentle_slopes", "banked_turns"]   // explicit list
   "sprites": "all"                                        // every group
   ```

   Use the explicit list when you want a minimal render for a vehicle
   that will only ever live on its native ride type — the loader ORs in
   implied flags too (`banking` → `diagonal_bank_transition`, etc).

   Use `"all"` when you want the vehicle to look correct even if a
   player swaps it onto a more capable ride type in-game (e.g. a
   wooden-coaster vehicle being placed on a hyper-coaster track with
   loops and corkscrews). This renders the full set of 16 sprite
   groups regardless of what `ride_type` normally uses — a few seconds
   more render time, larger parkobj, but no glitchy fallback sprites.
   The `examples/wooden/` config uses `"all"` for this reason.

3. **Pick a unique `id`.** Use the `openrct2vg.ride.<name>` namespace
   or your own (`<author>.ride.<name>`) — must not collide with
   vanilla.

4. **Iterate.** Use `--test` for fast feedback (one viewpoint per
   vehicle frame, ~1 s). Switch to a full run (~10 s) when you're
   happy with the model + lighting.

5. **Install.** Copy the `.parkobj` into OpenRCT2's `object/`
   directory; restart OpenRCT2. It appears in the Roller Coasters
   build menu as its own entry (with the `name` you gave it) and is
   also offered as a swap-in vehicle option for any placed ride with
   matching `ride_type`.

---

## Light source format

Default lighting is hard-coded in `__main__.py` (a 9-light rig matching
the upstream C++ `default_lights()`). To override, add a `lights` array
to the ride JSON:

```json
"lights": [
  {"type": "diffuse",  "shadow": false, "direction": [0, -1, 0],   "strength": 0.1},
  {"type": "specular", "shadow": false, "direction": [1, 1.65, -1], "strength": 1.0}
]
```

`direction` is normalized on load. `shadow: true` makes the light
respect occlusion (slower; cast shadow rays per pixel).
